## Overview

This guide covers advanced usage, extension, and contribution patterns for the Jirassic Pack CLI. It is intended for developers and contributors.

---

## Codebase Structure

- `jirassicpack/`
  - `cli.py` ‚Äî Main CLI entrypoint, argument parsing, config loading, feature dispatch
  - `config.py` ‚Äî Loads YAML, .env, and environment variables; handles option precedence
  - `jira_client.py` ‚Äî Handles all Jira API interactions with retry/timeout logic
  - `utils.py` ‚Äî Utilities for option access, validation, error handling, Markdown rendering, and prompt choices
  - `features/` ‚Äî One module per feature (e.g., `create_issue.py`, `bulk_operations.py`)
  - `metrics.py`, `summary.py` ‚Äî Additional reporting features
- `tests/` ‚Äî (If present) Unit and integration tests
- `README.md` ‚Äî User documentation
- `DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md` ‚Äî This file

---

## Key Patterns & Conventions

- **Unified Markdown Output:** All features that generate reports must use the `render_markdown_report` utility for `.md` files. This ensures a consistent, accessible, and branded output.
- **JSON Output:** Where appropriate, features should also output `.json` files for raw data (see Create/Update/Bulk features).
- **Context-Rich Logging:** All info and error messages should include context (feature, user, batch, suffix) for traceability.
- **Prompting & Validation:** Use `get_option`, `validate_required`, and `validate_date` for all user input. Use `prompt_with_validation` for custom validation.
- **Retry/Skip Logic:** Wrap all network/file operations in `retry_or_skip` to allow users to retry or skip on failure.
- **Batch Mode:** Use `unique_suffix` in all output filenames to avoid overwriting files in batch runs.

> **Jira Note:**
> **JQL** ‚Äì Jira Query Language, used to filter issues.

---

## Adding a New Feature

1. **Create a new module** in `jirassicpack/features/` (e.g., `my_feature.py`).
2. **Define a main function** (e.g., `def my_feature(jira, params, user_email=None, batch_index=None, unique_suffix=None):`).
3. **Prompt for options** using `get_option` from `utils.py`.
4. **Validate required fields** with `validate_required` and `validate_date`.
5. **Use `ensure_output_dir`** before writing any files.
6. **Use `unique_suffix`** in output filenames for batch safety.
7. **Wrap all file/network operations** in try/except and use the `error` utility for reporting.
8. **Register the feature** in `cli.py`'s `register_features()` and ensure it is mapped in `run_feature()`.
9. **Use the Markdown template** for all `.md` outputs. Add `.json` output if appropriate.
10. **Update the README and this guide** with new config/.env options and usage.

> **Jira Term:**
> **Issue** ‚Äì A single work item in Jira (e.g., bug, task, story).

---

## Output & Logging

- **Markdown:** Use `render_markdown_report` for all `.md` outputs. Do not write Markdown directly.
- **JSON:** Use a helper (e.g., `write_create_issue_json`) for `.json` outputs. Include all relevant fields.
- **Output Directory:** Use `output_dir` from options/config. Always call `ensure_output_dir`.
- **unique_suffix:** Always append to output filenames in batch mode.
- **Logging:**
  - Use the provided logger (`info`, `error`) for all user-facing and error output.
  - All logs include context: feature, user, batch, suffix.
  - Log format is JSON by default; can be switched to plain text for debugging.
  - Sensitive data (API tokens, passwords) are always redacted.
  - Example log entry:
    ```json
    {"asctime": "2024-06-10 12:34:56,123", "levelname": "ERROR", "name": "jirassicpack", "message": "Failed to fetch issues: 401 Unauthorized", "feature": "bulk_operations", "user": "alice@example.com", "batch": 0, "suffix": "_1718038490_0"}
    ```

---

## Error Handling & Troubleshooting

- **Error Handling:**
  - Always validate required parameters at the start of each feature. Use `validate_required` and `validate_date`.
  - Use `try/except` blocks around all network and file operations. Log errors with `error()` and include full context (feature, user, batch, suffix).
  - Use `retry_or_skip` for all network/file operations to allow user to retry or skip on failure.
  - For batch mode, ensure each feature's errors are reported in the batch summary.
  - Example:
    ```python
    try:
        issues = jira.search_issues(...)
    except Exception as e:
        error(f"Failed to fetch issues: {e}", extra=context)
        return
    ```
- **Testing Error Cases:**
  - Test missing required options, invalid dates, and network failures.
  - Ensure errors are logged and surfaced to the user as described above.

> **Jira Term:**
> **Worklog** ‚Äì A record of time spent on an issue.

---

## Testing

- Place tests in the `tests/` directory (if present).
- Use `pytest` or standard `unittest`.
- Test both happy paths and error cases (e.g., missing required options, invalid dates).
- Mock network calls to Jira for unit tests.
- Test Markdown and JSON output for structure and content.

---

## Versioning & Release

- **Versioning:**
  - Follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/): MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH
  - Update the version in the CLI and documentation for each release.
- **Release Process:**
  1. Ensure all features and documentation are up to date.
  2. Run all tests (unit, integration, output validation).
  3. Bump the version number.
  4. Tag the release in git and push to GitHub.
  5. Update the changelog (if present).
  6. Announce the release and update the README/DEVELOPER_GUIDE as needed.

  - Use `retry_or_skip` for all network/file operations to allow user to retry or skip on failure.
  - For batch mode, ensure each feature's errors are reported in the batch summary.
  - Example:
    ```python
    try:
        issues = jira.search_issues(...)
    except Exception as e:
        error(f"Failed to fetch issues: {e}", extra=context)
        return
    ```

- **Logging:**
  - Use the provided logger (`info`, `error`) for all user-facing and error output.
  - All logs include context: feature, user, batch, suffix.
  - Log format is JSON by default; can be switched to plain text for debugging.

    ```

## üìù Output & Testing

- **Markdown Output:**
  - Use `render_markdown_report` for all `.md` outputs. Do not write Markdown directly.
  - Include summary and details sections, and always use the unified template.
- **JSON Output:**
  - For create/update/bulk, use a helper to write `.json` output with all relevant fields.
- **Testing Output:**
  - Test both Markdown and JSON outputs for structure and content.
  - Use sample configs and check that output files are named correctly and contain expected data.
- **Testing Error Cases:**
  - Test missing required options, invalid dates, and network failures.
  - Ensure errors are logged and surfaced to the user as described above.

## üßë‚Äçüíª Example: Adding a Feature with Robust Error Handling & Logging

```python
def my_feature(jira, options, user_email=None, batch_index=None, unique_suffix=None):
    context = build_context("my_feature", user_email, batch_index, unique_suffix)
    # Validate required params
    user = options.get('user')
    if not validate_required(user, 'user'):
        error("'user' is required.", extra=context)
        return
    # Validate date
    start_date = options.get('start_date')
    if not validate_date(start_date, 'start_date'):
        error("'start_date' is invalid.", extra=context)
        return
    # Main operation with retry/skip
    try:
        with retry_or_skip("Fetching data from Jira", context=context):
            data = jira.get_data(user, start_date)
    except Exception as e:
        error(f"Failed to fetch data: {e}", extra=context)
        return
    # Write output
    try:
        filename = f"output/my_feature_{user}_{start_date}{unique_suffix}.md"
        content = render_markdown_report(
            feature="my_feature",
            user=user_email,
            batch=batch_index,
            suffix=unique_suffix,
            feature_title="My Feature",
            summary_section="...",
            main_content_section="..."
        )
        with open(filename, 'w') as f:
            f.write(content)
        info(f"My feature report written to {filename}", extra=context)
    except Exception as e:
        error(f"Failed to write report: {e}", extra=context)
```

## üß™ Example: Testing Error Cases

- **Missing Required Option:**
  - Config: `{}`
  - Expected: Error log and user message: `[ERROR] [my_feature] 'user' is required.`
- **Invalid Date:**
  - Config: `{user: 'alice', start_date: '2024-13-01'}`
  - Expected: Error log and user message: `[ERROR] [my_feature] 'start_date' is invalid.`
- **Network Failure:**
  - Simulate by disconnecting network or mocking API error.
  - Expected: Error log with traceback, user prompted to retry or skip.
