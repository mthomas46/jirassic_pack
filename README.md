## Installation
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Setup
1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in your Jira credentials and defaults.
2. (Optional) Copy `config.yaml.example` to `config.yaml` and customize your batch or single feature runs.

## Usage
### Interactive CLI
```bash
python -m jirassicpack.cli
```

### Single Feature with Config
```bash
python -m jirassicpack.cli --config=config.yaml
```

### Batch Mode (Multiple Features)
Add a `features:` list to your `config.yaml`:
```yaml
features:
  - name: create_issue
    options:
      project: DEMO
      summary: "Batch created issue"
  - name: advanced_metrics
    options:
      user: alice
      start_date: 2024-01-01
      end_date: 2024-01-31
```

### Environment Variables
See `.env.example` for all supported variables. Common ones:
- `JIRA_URL`, `JIRA_EMAIL`, `JIRA_API_TOKEN`
- `JIRA_OUTPUT_DIR`, etc.

### YAML Config Keys & Option Precedence
- `feature:` (single feature mode)
- `features:` (batch mode, list of features)
- `options:` (per-feature or global)
- **Precedence:** Per-feature options > global options > environment variables > defaults.
- See each feature's section below for required/optional keys.

### Output Files & unique_suffix
- All output files are written to the specified `output_dir` (default: `output`).
- In batch mode, each feature run appends a `unique_suffix` to its output file to avoid overwriting.
- Example: `output/advanced_metrics_alice_2024-01-01_to_2024-01-31_1681234567_0.md`

## Features & Option Keys
- **create_issue**: `project`, `summary`, `description`, `issue_type`
- **update_issue**: `issue_key`, `field`, `value`
- **bulk_operations**: `action`, `jql`, `value` (action: transition/comment/assign)
- **user_team_analytics**: `team`, `start_date`, `end_date`
- **integration_tools**: `integration_jql` (**not** just `jql`)
- **time_tracking_worklogs**: `user`, `start_date`, `end_date`
- **automated_documentation**: `doc_type`, `project`, `version`, `sprint`
- **advanced_metrics**: `user`, `start_date`, `end_date`
- **sprint_board_management**: `board_name`

> **Note:** For `integration_tools`, use `integration_jql` as the key for your JQL query. Other features use `jql` or feature-specific keys.

## Error Handling & Validation
- All required fields are validated before making API calls or writing files. If a required field is missing, the script will print an error and skip the feature.
- All date fields are validated to be in `YYYY-MM-DD` format.
- All file and network operations are wrapped in try/except blocks. Errors are printed with context using a consistent format.
- Output directories are created automatically if they do not exist. If the directory is invalid or not writable, an error is printed.
- All output files in batch mode use a unique suffix to avoid overwriting.

## Troubleshooting & FAQ
- **Missing required option**: Check your config and required keys for the feature.
- **Jira connection errors**: Check your `.env` and network access.
- **Output not generated**: Ensure `output_dir` exists or is writable.
- **Batch mode**: Each feature run gets a unique output file suffix.
- **integration_tools**: Use `integration_jql` for the JQL key.
- **Config merging**: In batch mode, per-feature options override global options and environment variables.

## Advanced Usage Examples

### Using Environment Variables and Config Together
You can set defaults in your `.env` file or environment, and override them in your `config.yaml`:
```env
# .env
JIRA_URL=https://your-domain.atlassian.net
JIRA_EMAIL=your-email@example.com
JIRA_API_TOKEN=your-api-token
JIRA_OUTPUT_DIR=output
```
```yaml
# config.yaml
feature: create_issue
options:
  project: DEMO
  summary: "This summary overrides the .env default"
  output_dir: custom_output
```

### Advanced Batch Mode with Global and Per-Feature Options
You can specify global options and override them per feature:
```yaml
features:
  - name: create_issue
    options:
      project: DEMO
      summary: "Batch created issue"
  - name: advanced_metrics
    options:
      user: alice
      start_date: 2024-01-01
      end_date: 2024-01-31
  - name: bulk_operations
    options:
      action: comment
      jql: "project = DEMO AND status = 'To Do'"
      value: "This is a batch comment"
output_dir: batch_output
```

### Custom Output Directories and File Naming
Set a custom output directory and see how unique_suffix is used:
```yaml
features:
  - name: time_tracking_worklogs
    options:
      user: alice
      start_date: 2024-01-01
      end_date: 2024-01-31
      output_dir: worklogs_output
```
Output file: `worklogs_output/alice_2024-01_to_2024-01-31_worklogs_<unique_suffix>.md`

### Example: Parallel/Concurrent Batch Runs
If you run multiple batch jobs at the same time, each will have a unique suffix:
- `output/advanced_metrics_alice_2024-01-01_to_2024-01-31_1681234567_0.md`
- `output/advanced_metrics_alice_2024-01-01_to_2024-01-31_1681234570_0.md`

### Example: integration_tools with integration_jql
```yaml
feature: integration_tools
options:
  integration_jql: "project = DEMO AND status = 'Done'"
  output_dir: integration_links
```
Output file: `integration_links/integration_links<unique_suffix>.md`

### Example: Error Handling in Config
If a required option is missing, the script will print an error and skip the feature:
```yaml
feature: create_issue
options:
  # project is missing!
  summary: "This will trigger a validation error"
```
Output:
```
[ERROR] project is required.
```

### Example: Using Password Prompts
If you omit `JIRA_API_TOKEN` in your config and environment, you will be prompted securely at runtime.

### Example: Using Choices in Prompts
For features like `automated_documentation`, you will be prompted to select from valid choices if not set in config:
```
Select documentation type:
  ‚Ä¢ Release notes
  ‚Ä¢ Changelog
  ‚Ä¢ Sprint Review
```

## Logging & Audit Trail

Jirassic Pack now uses **structured JSON logging** by default. All CLI and feature actions are logged to `jirassicpack.log` as one JSON object per line. This makes logs easy to parse, search, and analyze with log management tools.

- Each log entry includes: timestamp, log level, feature name, user, batch index, unique suffix, and message.
- All configuration and options are logged with sensitive data (API tokens, passwords) redacted.
- All requests to and responses from Jira are logged at DEBUG level (enable with `--log-level=DEBUG` or `JIRASSICPACK_LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG`).
- Log rotation is enabled: each log file is limited to 5MB, with up to 5 backups retained.
- User interruptions (Ctrl+C) and all exceptions are logged with full tracebacks.

**Example JSON log entry:**
```json
{"asctime": "2024-06-10 12:34:56,123", "levelname": "INFO", "name": "jirassicpack", "message": "Feature complete", "feature": "create_issue", "user": "alice@example.com", "batch": 0, "suffix": "_1718038490_0"}
```

**Switching Log Format:**
- By default, logs are in JSON. To use plain text logs, set the environment variable:
  ```bash
  export JIRASSICPACK_LOG_FORMAT=plain
  ```
- To switch back to JSON:
  ```bash
  export JIRASSICPACK_LOG_FORMAT=json
  ```

**Sensitive Data Handling:**
- API tokens, passwords, and similar secrets are always redacted in logs.
- Never share your log file without reviewing for sensitive project data.

**Enabling Debug Logging:**
- Run the CLI with `python -m jirassicpack.cli --log-level=DEBUG` or set the environment variable `JIRASSICPACK_LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG` to capture all Jira API communications.

**Log File Location:**
- All logs are written to `jirassicpack.log` in the working directory. Log rotation ensures old logs are preserved as `jirassicpack.log.1`, `jirassicpack.log.2`, etc.

This logging system ensures you have a full audit trail of feature usage, configuration, and Jira API interactions for troubleshooting and compliance. 

## ü¶ñ Prompt/Spinner Separation & Robust UX Pattern

All features in Jirassic Pack follow a robust, user-friendly pattern:

- **Parameter gathering and validation** (including display of required/optional parameters) always happens **before** any spinner is started.
- **Spinners** only wrap network/file operations (API calls, file writes, etc.), never user prompts or validation.
- This ensures that prompts are always visible and never hidden by a spinner, for both interactive and batch modes.
- In batch mode, all parameters are resolved from config/env before any operation begins.

**Example pattern for contributors:**
```python
# In your feature module:
def prompt_my_feature_options(options):
    # Gather all parameters here (prompt, validate, merge config/env)
    ...
    return params

def my_feature(jira, params, ...):
    # Only perform the operation here, with spinner if needed
    with spinner("Doing work..."):
        ... # API/file operation
```

**This pattern is enforced for all features.**
